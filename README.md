# Handwriting document generation

## Description

This tool serves a basic purpose to convert any document to handwritten text that will be displayed on another document.

## How to use?

1. Download the ZIP file of the project and open its source folder.

2. Navigate to input word document and update it as you like and save it.

3. Now run handwriting.py using this command
   
   ```python 
   python handwriting.py

4. Observe the results in handwritten_generated_doc.docx

## Another method:

Dare to try this in handwritten text input of user that'll involve ANN's, large training that can go wrong and docx generated incorrectly.
Hence using online fonts is my preferred choice.
